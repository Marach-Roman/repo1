Alien Invasion

## Description
Creating a simple game "Alien Invasion" in Python (an improvement on the Python Crash Course 2).

# Game Overview
In "Alien Invasion," the user controls a rocket ship that starts at the bottom of the screen.
The player can move the ship left and right using the arrow keys on the keyboard or shoot by pressing the space bar.
As the game begins, a fleet of aliens appears on the screen and starts moving sideways and downward.
The player must shoot and destroy the aliens.
If the user destroys all the aliens, a new armada appears, moving faster than the previous one.
If at least one alien touches the ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses the ship.
If the user loses three ships, the game is over.

## Improvements
- The game features a main menu with various program windows (Help window, Game window, and Settings window).
- The main menu includes background music.
- The gameplay has a basic art style.
- Plans for the Future
# Necessary
- Sound Effects: Currently, the game has some sound effects. I plan to add sound effects for shooting, alien destruction, and more.
- Bonuses: When the player meets certain conditions (e.g., destroys a specific number of aliens), they will receive bonuses (such as an increase in the ship's width).
- Animation: Implement simple animations for the ship and aliens.
- Help Window: Revamp the information, design, and content in the Help window to make it more engaging.
- Settings Window: Implement a Settings window with options for language selection, volume control, toggling sound effects, and more.
- Pause Functionality: Add a pause button in the Play window.
- Game Download Function: Create an .exe file and package all necessary files for easier distribution (for personal experience and convenience, not for advertising).
# Not Necessarily
- Design: Improve game design, such as using video animation for the background and other enhancements.
- Alien Properties: Introduce various alien types with different colors and properties:
    - Green: Ordinary aliens (currently implemented).
    - Yellow: Medium-level aliens that require multiple shots to be destroyed.
    - Red: Most dangerous aliens that require multiple shots and cause surrounding aliens to be destroyed upon their destruction.
    - Blue: Aliens that freeze the entire fleet for a certain period.
- Shop: If feasible, add a shop with in-game currency where players can buy ship skins and views that can be changed in the settings.
